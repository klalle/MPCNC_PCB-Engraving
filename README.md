# MPCNC-PCB Milling

I finally tied to mill a custom PCB with my MPCNC, and my CNC did not let me down this time either! =)
As you see on the pic below I really need to get a better engraving bit... 
had to sand off the roughly cutt copper edges and then draw a sharp edge thrue all the traces to make sure no copper was left, shorting it out...

I have never routed a PCB before, so this was a first, and I had no id√©a of what programs to use, but this is how I did it: 

##Schematics in Eagle 
1. Since this is an one sided copper clad board, I placed all the thrue-hole compoents on the front layer, and the surface mounted ESP-03 on the back layer (mirrored)

2. All the routes where done on the Backside-layer and I used the Auto-routing and dide some touchup manually...
3. I made a polyline-area that defined the board cut-out on layer 249 (Edge)
4. Exported three files
	*Routes and Cutout with Device: "GERBER_RS274X"
	*Drills/Holes with "EXCELON_24"

##Created gcode with FlatCAM
1. Typed: "set_sys excellon_zeros T" in command-line (bootom of window) to be able to import Eagle-files correctly (done only once)
2. Imported the two gerber-files and the Excelon-file and made sure they lined up
3. Followed [this](https://www.inventables.com/projects/how-to-mill-a-through-hole-pcb) guidet to export gcodes
4. Followed [this](http://caram.cl/software/flatcam/board-cutout-with-flatcam/) guide to make custom board cutout
5. Exported the files without file-ending (without ".gcode") to the folder called "PostProcess"

##Post Procesor
1. I made a custom post-procesor <b>"PostProcessGcodes.bat"</b> to match the gcode that the post processor for F360 puts out.
  *It's a bat-script and needs "Sed" to be installed download Sed.exe for windows [here](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/sed.htm) 
  *Just put the bat-file next to the folder "PostProcess" and dubble click the file, it will generate three gcode-files of the files in the folder
  *The speeds are all set in the post processor! changes in FlatCAM will be overwritten! change in notepad++ to match your needs!

##Routing
1. Put the three gcode files on an SD-card and plugged it in to MPCNC
2. Used my custom functions to probe for Z with zero probe offset, used the copper clad as GND instead of probe metal piece...
3. Used a 45 deg V-bit for the engraving (really need to get a new sharp one), 1mm end mill for holes and 1.5mm end mill for cut out

I was really hapy that my [custom LCD-menu](https://github.com/klalle/Marlin_RC7_LCD_Customization) did it's job and I made use of a lot of my custom functions!
